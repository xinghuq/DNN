Title: A Fast Neural Network Tool for Big Data Analysis
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2022-04-28
Description: A fast implementation of deep learning for various big data anaysis. 
      It is developed particularly for genomic studies. There are multiple functions that can be extended 
      to other Omics data analysis, such as single cell Omics. This package adopted optimized algorithms such as backpropagation, Rprop, 
      simulated annealing, stochastic gradient and pruning algorithms such as minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon 
      based on a fast implementation of compressed neural networks (Grzegorz Klima, 2016).
