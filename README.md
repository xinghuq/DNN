
# A Fast Neural Network Tool for Big Data Analysis



# Introduction
 
It is developed particularly for genomic studies. There are multiple functions that can be extended to other Omics data analysis, such as single cell Omics. This package adopted optimized algorithms such as backpropagation, Rprop, simulated annealing, stochastic gradient and pruning algorithms such as minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon based on a fast implementation of compressed neural networks (Grzegorz Klima, 2016).
